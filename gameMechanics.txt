Gold & Crystal
--------------

How is personal gold handled relative to vault gold?
- what are you carrying, vs. what is stored?
- what happens when you de-rez?
- what is in the vaults?
It's weird to have 2 values to keep track of. (Although "in the bank" vs. "in the wallet" is normal in RL). 
And it's not really fun.
Should show one total: assumed on player. Penalty when dropped?
