Gold & Crystal
--------------

How is personal gold handled relative to vault gold?
- what are you carrying, vs. what is stored?
- what happens when you de-rez?
- what is in the vaults?
It's weird to have 2 values to keep track of. (Although "in the bank" vs. "in the wallet" is normal in RL). 
And it's not really fun.
Should show one total: assumed on player. Penalty when dropped?

Markets
-------

Need markets to buy/sell stuff. Where is the gold??

Sell to QueueCore (tax paid to domain)
Buy from market (tax paid to domain)
How does market get stuff??

Sell to Market. Buy from Market. (Taxed)
Market can run out of money.

Hybrid:
Sell to Market.
Buy from Market
Market can overflow to QueueCore

Start simple: put the gold in the market. Pay taxes to core.
