x control key is terrible...sometimes.
- remove 'inUse' flag
- explosion is in the wrong direction. Units walk through explosions?? (Balrog vs. Human.)
- does fire affect plants??
- health is awkward: keeps copy of HP (oops). move hp to health component? (TotalHP() on item?)
- need free camera mode
- remove temporary arbitrary AI limit in corescript

- game
	- Intermission: regions
		x generate regions
		x generate roads
		x burn to map
		x update zones
		x update pathfinder. limit to sectors.
		x limit AI
			x detection and awareness to sector bounds
		x fix cores to work with sectors
		x limit bolts / collisions
		x grid motion
		x refactor gamescene - map and mini-map clicking should use the same code
		x pather per sector
		- fix inUse. wow. fix inUse. Then only isBlocked will be an awful hack.
		- herding across grids
			- herding notification
		- test fast mode
		- textures
			x grid
			- port. bake lighting.
		- load existing world
		- fix AI to not charge into melee if ranged is a better idea
		- fix camera dragging bug
		- simpler shaders
		- overnight test
	- Flora 2
		- weapon toggle / selection
		- level up
		- character screeen
		- pony-unicorn-pegasus news prioritization
		- fix annoying hp out of range bug
		- rain, general de-saturation
		- aging of stone
		- disable buttons on main ui when no game saved
	- Fauna 2
		- teams. friend-enemy-neutral logic.
		- monster ecology
		- visitors
		- inventory screen
	- Building
		- construction
		- economics
		- domain building
	- AI
		- other cores doing the same

- combat test scene	
	x connect item to procedural rendering of melee weapon
	- weapon types
	- animation speed isn't correct
	- gunrun to walk not synchronized correctly
	- revisit accuracy comuptation. what scales with distance? area? volume? radius?
	- melee attack goes back to reference position between hits

	- AI (task AI)
		- removing unit "clumping" (3yr old soccer team). Basic formation?
		- establish friend vs. enemy
		- basic states
		- CA to handle friends and enemies
		- refactor code - if needed? - in AIComponent (the fixmes)
	- UI
		x set up different battles
		- battle results

	- serialization

- render-through for player behind objects
- add target portrait
- faces are using too much memory, or too low res...hmmm. Should really use texture packer and store a lookup.
- handle device loss in live preview
- particles aren't additive correctly
d GT bug: reconsider auto-mip. review texture upload. 
- bone filter in reverse. more efficient and useful.
- put metadata in model (authoring  time)
x rationalize hardpoints: array index or flag? lookt at RenderComponent
x mantis trigger broken
- switch to ImageMagick for texture scaling
- credits scene
x particles should use palette. <color palette="2 3 1.0"/> possibly
- remove normalization in shader
- print uniform count for shaders
- animition aware hit testing
- bounds need to be adjusted to account for animation
- cameras only self-delete if they reach destination; should do better. Probably
  should only be one camera in existence. (BlueSmoke, NavTest2)
- record perf max/min. surprisingly hard.
x shadows should be part of space-tree bounds
- memory pool everything in the chit/component system
- analyze/optimize what causes component update: DoTick(), etc. Likely many DoTicks() getting called that aren't needed. (especially rendering...)
- add rez effect for item switch?
- animation generation
- volcanoes: taper at the end
- zoom way out
- peaks news

----------- FIXED -------------

x Fauna 1
	x motion around cores
	x monsters to fight
	x battles!
	x control of target
	x target highlight
x mantis tribes - whos fighting who?
x awareness range is a little high. dobule the awareness (?) should forget even a focused target.
x check that shields and damage absorbing is working correctly. something seems wrong with shields - recharge?
x shield glow broken. so hard to tell not sure it's worth doing.
x The item / weapon system really isn't working, and it's complex. Needs coordination between
  renderer, item, and weapon system to know the current weapon. (!!) Would rather have a one
  weapon system (where the current weapon can be switched out.) See ComuteLeadingShot()
x Flora
	x plants
		x growth, spread
		x rotation
		x saturation to hp
	x fix the stupid camera
	x weather
	x player recreation
	x avatar face display
	x debug UI toggle
	x new assets from Shroom
	x change main face
	x long test
	x date on main screen
	x move down buttons
x Land and Water
	x generate a random world
	x save / load
		x 'shelf'
		x save, load, cycle buttons
		x optimize cycle time (fast png write?): not much to do here, without swapping out the encoder
		x save bolts
	x walk around it
		x where is world origin? mini-map origin? save/load origin? line all that up
		x mark location on mini-map
- Rock and Stream
	x rock formation
		x need more local height variation
	x cave
	x pools
	x waterfall
	x lava gen
	x fast-step world sim
x need different particle effect for melee impact
x run & gun and explosive weapons is probably a bad idea. But shoot for explosive should
  be much more likely.
x chits should have "update time" not boolean flag
x volcano delayed on save/load cycle (size getting set to zero?)
x water creation seems deferred to save/load cycle. SetRock() not quite correct?
x assert when clicking on location player can't go
x crash on exit
x really must fix the shadow popping bug. and bounds calc for that.
x need teleport mode
x save / load rocks
x get stuck when teleporting
x drawcalls debugging for all scenes
x procedural rendering
	x more glasses colors
	x fix glasses: they can be tightly packed, and occurance done in script
	d procedural: the shading should "go through" so that a shadow on layer 3 is renderered below colors are layer0
	x move texture coordinate calc to script
	x static scene showing item combinations
	x emissive support
	x item bone/part support
	x re-organize the palette?
	x color variation 
	x color variation for live mode
x battle scene
	x ranged weapons
		x accuracy
		x effect
		X reload time 'reload'
		X time per shot 'cooldown'
		X rounds in clip
	x ranged accuracy / weapon types / ItemStat data
	x add de-rez
	x unique look for units so teams can be distinguished
	x buttons to select scenario, load items
	x shock should affect shields, fire should diminish even when flammable, and shockable should diminish
	x restore micropather cache
	X error in ray-cast: detecting a 'tree' where it shouldn't (near the head of the prime)
	x adjust particles to have "impact" effect
	X don't check for item destroyed/death on DAMAGE msg - needs to be moved to tick.
	x bolts are hitting own team	
	X eval: kinetic damage of held weapons shouldn't be multiplied with mass (added)
	X properly hook up items and such, so that items, health, all be driven correctly
	X fix particle def to return a default - the pointer is dangerous
	X DebugDraw is getting used for release drawing - fine in most (all?) cases. But clean up.
	X hesitation when near melee target (probably squatted destination code kicking in)
	  (possibly shader kicking in: never seen it happen twice). Not actually fixed - may need
	  GL optimizer - but definitely the shader kicking in
	X weapons
		X relative positioning (implemented, broken again)
		X weapon definition - item question: how is a chit a weapon?
		X item d	X why does balrog just stand around not attacking mantis
	X ...and yet the AOE of melee seems huge. clean all that up.
	X human runs up to dummy, circles around it
	X data driven item creation
	X leaving guy standing after battle
	X debugging info for chit ticks
	X back in the tick system: the "need tick" vs. "no tick" changes. Note for 
	  example whether an item has effects applied. Or the kind of animation. Don't
	  want to tick granite chunks when they don't need it. Key concerns: 
	  Rendering, Item that changes tick status
	X melee attack standing too close 
	X avoiding while pathing doesn't look quite correct
	X need left/right team, not species based
	X animation/lack of making me crazy. What plan?
	X particle effect for melee strike not "connected" to character
	X item definition: one big wad of data? handle "inherited items"?
	X use space tree query for impacted items. Everything that has a spatial component
	  is now in the table, so this should be "fixed".
	X need to check rotation in the path component
	X load in the correct lighting
	X put in license header
	X push to altera site
	X balrog fire attack
	X visual debugging: line drawing. check bolt impacts.
	X impact (light/heavy)
	X heavy weapons should do knockback, not just amount of damage/explosion
	X change bolt color
	X item: support speed, pass on to bolts
	X optimize start time
	X change effect strategy - are all effects just flags?
	X shields, general bonus/cost/damage propegation
	X knife -> ring
	X bolts don't hit own team but explosions do. decided this was a good thing.

x bolts
	d range
	x effect strength
	x damage (defined)
	x speed
	x compute color
x effects
	x effects spread to nearby when they should
	x flaming sword
	x flaming sword should catch things on fire when it hits
X Need BSearch and QSort
X the render::Item class doesn't make much sense any more. should probaly just be a reference to the Model
X what is going on with engine state when there are 2 textures?
X RenderState search is reversed
X clean up shields
X move EngineShaders local
X one item array
X extend rendering test to animation
X output drawcalls per state
X clean up instance rendering
X particle test scene
	X alpha processing for additive blending
	D particle groups (ex: fire)
X ECR: proper rotation support
X feature: Animation
	X figure out animation needs (standing, walking, sidestep, shooting, etc.)
	X define skeletal animation export
	X modify shaders
	X blend animations
X rotation: in spatial component? Matrix or Quat?
X NavTest-1 is broken. More container fallout. And once again an existing bug
  revealed by tighter container code.
X container to support copy semantics
X remove particle params not needed for world
X move lighting loading from render test scene to engine
X Animation
	X support for instancing
	X particle tracking of meta-data
	X item tracking of meta-data
	X timing of impact / shoot / hit events
	X need impact animation (light & heavy?)
	X remove rotation twist for ortho
	X animation rate
	X cross fading
	X revisit all scenes, add animation
		X Where does animation fit in? walk, gun-run, impact-, melee
		X Render: query walking/standing from Move component?
		X The AnimatedRenderComponent is annoying - move code to RenderComponent
X blur: switch to "down blit" approach, optionally
X Blue Smoke Map Test
	X full size (1024x1024), 2000 units
		X faster avoidance
			X separate avoid queries from spatial queries
			X hash scheme needs work
		X faster Model::Update
			X don't re-link if possible on update. model probably is in the same node.
			X faster AABB calc? are we using normals? should we?
			D don't update things well outside the rendering area? switch to local rendering?
			D re-tune tree size
			X switch to sphere testing. avoid flushing the AABB entirely
	X need to get to 2000 faster
	X entity debug system: point at chit, get component info
	X some units get stuck and never move (pathing fails & doesn't re-start?)
	X fix camera code
	X need a mini-map
	X filling of path cache: correct? why does the cache keep incrementing? what should the game do when it's full?
	X show region code
	D profiler max-ing out
	D much better test bitmap
	X 2 continents
	X bridge

X pathing
	X record path miss in cache
	X test cache miss 
	X print cache use
X navigation scene
	X map with pathing
	X chits & components
	X debugging components for showing collision/vectors
	X ground flocking motion
	X different size unitsX PathMoveComponent: can get blocked if 'dest' is being squatted by a unit.
X chits, components
X rotation: in spatial component? Matrix or Quat?
X move particle system to engine
X particle textures "popping in" (fix: was incorrectly passing 3 components in the attributes)
x instance scene
	x shadows
	x glow
	x hemispherical lighting
X desktop (art):
	X light model
	X test models
X streamline render atom creation
X work out atom usage
X create dialog scene
	X standard layout
	X automatic callback
	X drag / drop
X move Engine to Scene / move engine to correct place
X draw dude on map
	X with shader
	X clean up opengl = 2
X convert to tinyxml2
