Currently:
- farm efficiency
- weapon quality
Consider:
- sleep tube limit
- food limit
- grid access
- food drives population?

---------- Defer ----------
x mobs rush new domains (teleport out? really really sector herd?)
d different porch color for usable buildings
d volcanos: taper at the end
d zoom way out
d put metadata in model (authoring  time)
d render-through for player behind objects
d change shield to have cooldown then charge-up (rather than cooldown then reset)
d unify rockgen and worldgen. frustrating they are separate steps. or don't pass height to rockgen?
d AIs should account for personality and skills when doing inventory sorting
d rings deflect bolts. too much AI change.
d switch to ImageMagick for texture scaling
- animation sync is generally flakey - lock to vsync? Not aware of any way to solve this.
d when loading during grid travel, you sometimes back up. (Regen path on load; chooses wrong starting point. annoying to fix).
d GT bug: reconsider auto-mip. review texture upload. 
d bone filter in reverse. more efficient and useful.
- use optimizer to pre-process shaders
- bolt: glow around white core? end caps?
- particles that aren't quads (beziers)
- pack animation bone info into shaders
- effects
	- environment: water contains fire, spreads shock
	- down chain: a fire creature should catch things on fire that it holds

V2 ideas:
- content popups when you are near a kiosk (email from GT)
- "populous style" rocks. diagonals, points.
- level up grid and special skills

  Meh: initial test showed no advantage.

x The item / weapon system really isn't working, and it's complex. Needs coordination between
