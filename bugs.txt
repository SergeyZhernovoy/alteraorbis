- record perf max/min. surprisingly hard.
- Blue Smoke Map Test
	- full size (1024x1024), 2000 units
	X 2 continents
	X bridge
	- some units get stuck and never move (pathing fails & doesn't re-start?)
	- need a mini-map
	- need to get to 2000 faster
	- filling of path cache: correct?
	- show region code
	- profiler max-ing out


- shadows should be part of space-tree bounds
- memory pool everything in the chit/component system
- container to support copy semantics
X particle test scene
	X alpha processing for additive blending
	- particle groups (ex: fire)
- combat test scene


** LOW PRI **
- rotation: in spatial component? Matrix or Quat?

** ECR **

- ECR: proper rotation support
- feature: Animation
	- figure out animation needs (standing, walking, sidestep, shooting, etc.)
	- define skeletal animation export
	- modify shaders
	- blend animations


X pathing
	X record path miss in cache
	X test cache miss 
	X print cache use
X navigation scene
	X map with pathing
	X chits & components
	X debugging components for showing collision/vectors
	X ground flocking motion
	X different size unitsX PathMoveComponent: can get blocked if 'dest' is being squatted by a unit.
X chits, components
X rotation: in spatial component? Matrix or Quat?
X move particle system to engine
X particle textures "popping in" (fix: was incorrectly passing 3 components in the attributes)
x instance scene
	x shadows
	x glow
	x hemispherical lighting
X desktop (art):
	X light model
	X test models
X streamline render atom creation
X work out atom usage
X create dialog scene
	X standard layout
	X automatic callback
	X drag / drop
X move Engine to Scene / move engine to correct place
X draw dude on map
	X with shader
	X clean up opengl = 2
X convert to tinyxml2
