- combat test scene
	- shields
	- impact (light/heavy)
	- removing unit "clumping" (3yr old soccer team). Basic formation?
	- unique look for units so teams can be distinguished
	- properly hook up items and such, so that items, health, all be driven correctly
	- buttons to select scenario, load items
	- animation speed isn't correct
	- adjust particles to have "impact" effect
	- add de-rez
	- flaming sword
	- flaming sword should catch things on fire
	- refactor code - if needed? - in AIComponent (the fixmes)
	- gunrun to walk not synchronized correctly

	- ranged weapons
		- bolts
			- damage (defined)
			d speed
			d range
			- compute color
			d effect strength
		d accuracy
		- reload time 'reload'
		- time per shot 'cooldown'
		- rounds in clip
		d effect
	X weapons
		X relative positioning (implemented, broken again)
		X weapon definition - item question: how is a chit a weapon?
		X item definition
	- AI (task AI)
		- establish friend vs. enemy
		- basic states
		- CA to handle friends and enemies
	- UI
		- set up different battles
		- battle results

	- serialization
	- hesitation when near melee target (probably squatted destination code kicking in)
	  (possibly shader kicking in: never seen it happen twice)
	- error in ray-cast: detecting a 'tree' where it shouldn't (near the head of the prime)
	- add rez and de-rez effect for chits

	X why does balrog just stand around not attacking mantis
	X ...and yet the AOE of melee seems huge. clean all that up.
	X human runs up to dummy, circles around it
	X data driven item creation
	X leaving guy standing after battle
	X debugging info for chit ticks
	X back in the tick system: the "need tick" vs. "no tick" changes. Note for 
	  example whether an item has effects applied. Or the kind of animation. Don't
	  want to tick granite chunks when they don't need it. Key concerns: 
	  Rendering, Item that changes tick status
	X melee attack standing too close 
	X avoiding while pathing doesn't look quite correct
	X need left/right team, not species based
	X animation/lack of making me crazy. What plan?
	X particle effect for melee strike not "connected" to character
	X item definition: one big wad of data? handle "inherited items"?
	X use space tree query for impacted items. Everything that has a spatial component
	  is now in the table, so this should be "fixed".
	X need to check rotation in the path component
	X load in the correct lighting


- animition aware hit testing
- bounds need to be adjusted to account for animation
- what is going on with engine state when there are 2 textures?
- cameras only self-delete if they reach destination; should do better. Probably
  should only be one camera in existence. (BlueSmoke, NavTest2)
- record perf max/min. surprisingly hard.
- shadows should be part of space-tree bounds
- memory pool everything in the chit/component system
- analyze/optimize what causes component update: DoTick(), etc. Likely many DoTicks() getting called that aren't needed. (especially rendering...)
- pack animation bone info into shaders

X particle test scene
	X alpha processing for additive blending
	D particle groups (ex: fire)


** ECR **

** Defer **
- particles that aren't quads (beziers)

----------- FIXED -------------

X ECR: proper rotation support
X feature: Animation
	X figure out animation needs (standing, walking, sidestep, shooting, etc.)
	X define skeletal animation export
	X modify shaders
	X blend animations
X rotation: in spatial component? Matrix or Quat?
X NavTest-1 is broken. More container fallout. And once again an existing bug
  revealed by tighter container code.
X container to support copy semantics
X remove particle params not needed for world
X move lighting loading from render test scene to engine
X Animation
	X support for instancing
	X particle tracking of meta-data
	X item tracking of meta-data
	X timing of impact / shoot / hit events
	X need impact animation (light & heavy?)
	X remove rotation twist for ortho
	X animation rate
	X cross fading
	X revisit all scenes, add animation
		X Where does animation fit in? walk, gun-run, impact-, melee
		X Render: query walking/standing from Move component?
		X The AnimatedRenderComponent is annoying - move code to RenderComponent
X blur: switch to "down blit" approach, optionally
X Blue Smoke Map Test
	X full size (1024x1024), 2000 units
		X faster avoidance
			X separate avoid queries from spatial queries
			X hash scheme needs work
		X faster Model::Update
			X don't re-link if possible on update. model probably is in the same node.
			X faster AABB calc? are we using normals? should we?
			D don't update things well outside the rendering area? switch to local rendering?
			D re-tune tree size
			X switch to sphere testing. avoid flushing the AABB entirely
	X need to get to 2000 faster
	X entity debug system: point at chit, get component info
	X some units get stuck and never move (pathing fails & doesn't re-start?)
	X fix camera code
	X need a mini-map
	X filling of path cache: correct? why does the cache keep incrementing? what should the game do when it's full?
	X show region code
	D profiler max-ing out
	D much better test bitmap
	X 2 continents
	X bridge

X pathing
	X record path miss in cache
	X test cache miss 
	X print cache use
X navigation scene
	X map with pathing
	X chits & components
	X debugging components for showing collision/vectors
	X ground flocking motion
	X different size unitsX PathMoveComponent: can get blocked if 'dest' is being squatted by a unit.
X chits, components
X rotation: in spatial component? Matrix or Quat?
X move particle system to engine
X particle textures "popping in" (fix: was incorrectly passing 3 components in the attributes)
x instance scene
	x shadows
	x glow
	x hemispherical lighting
X desktop (art):
	X light model
	X test models
X streamline render atom creation
X work out atom usage
X create dialog scene
	X standard layout
	X automatic callback
	X drag / drop
X move Engine to Scene / move engine to correct place
X draw dude on map
	X with shader
	X clean up opengl = 2
X convert to tinyxml2
