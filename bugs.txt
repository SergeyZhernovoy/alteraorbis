- Animation
	X support for instancing
	X particle tracking of meta-data
	X item tracking of meta-data
	- animition aware hit testing
	X timing of impact / shoot / hit events
	X need impact animation (light & heavy?)
	- bounds need to be adjusted to account for animation
	- 2nd test animation, with a scaled size
	X remove rotation twist for ortho
	X animation rate
	X cross fading
	X revisit all scenes, add animation
		Where does animation fit in? walk, gun-run, impact-, melee
		X Render: query walking/standing from Move component?
		X The AnimatedRenderComponent is annoying - move code to RenderComponent

- combat test scene
	X animation/lack of making me crazy. What plan?
	X particle effect for melee strick not "connected" to character
	- item definition: one big wad of data? handle "inherited items"?
	- properly hook up items and such, so that items, health, all be driven correctly
	- use space tree query for impacted items
	- data driven item creation
	- need to check rotation in the path component
	- buttons to select scenario, load items
	- load in the correct lighting

	- weapons
		- relative positioning (implemented, broken again)
		- weapon definition - item question: how is a chit a weapon?
		- item definition
	- AI (task AI)
		- establish friend vs. enemy
		- basic states
		- CA to handle friends and enemies
	- UI
		- set up different battles

	- serialization
	- hesitation when near melee target (probably squatted destination code kicking in)
	  (possibly shader kicking in: never scene it happen twice)
	- error in ray-cast: detecting a 'tree' where it shouldn't (near the head of the prime)
	- add rez and de-rez effect for chits


X remove particle params not needed for world
- move lighting loading from render test scene to engine
- cameras only self-delete if they reach destination; should do better. Probably
  should only be one camera in existence. (BlueSmoke, NavTest2)
- record perf max/min. surprisingly hard.
- shadows should be part of space-tree bounds
- memory pool everything in the chit/component system
- container to support copy semantics

X particle test scene
	X alpha processing for additive blending
	- particle groups (ex: fire)


** LOW PRI **
- rotation: in spatial component? Matrix or Quat?

** ECR **

- ECR: proper rotation support
- feature: Animation
	- figure out animation needs (standing, walking, sidestep, shooting, etc.)
	- define skeletal animation export
	- modify shaders
	- blend animations

** Defer **
- particles that aren't quads (beziers)


X blur: switch to "down blit" approach, optionally
X Blue Smoke Map Test
	X full size (1024x1024), 2000 units
		X faster avoidance
			X separate avoid queries from spatial queries
			X hash scheme needs work
		X faster Model::Update
			X don't re-link if possible on update. model probably is in the same node.
			X faster AABB calc? are we using normals? should we?
			D don't update things well outside the rendering area? switch to local rendering?
			D re-tune tree size
			X switch to sphere testing. avoid flushing the AABB entirely
	X need to get to 2000 faster
	X entity debug system: point at chit, get component info
	X some units get stuck and never move (pathing fails & doesn't re-start?)
	X fix camera code
	X need a mini-map
	X filling of path cache: correct? why does the cache keep incrementing? what should the game do when it's full?
	X show region code
	D profiler max-ing out
	D much better test bitmap
	X 2 continents
	X bridge

X pathing
	X record path miss in cache
	X test cache miss 
	X print cache use
X navigation scene
	X map with pathing
	X chits & components
	X debugging components for showing collision/vectors
	X ground flocking motion
	X different size unitsX PathMoveComponent: can get blocked if 'dest' is being squatted by a unit.
X chits, components
X rotation: in spatial component? Matrix or Quat?
X move particle system to engine
X particle textures "popping in" (fix: was incorrectly passing 3 components in the attributes)
x instance scene
	x shadows
	x glow
	x hemispherical lighting
X desktop (art):
	X light model
	X test models
X streamline render atom creation
X work out atom usage
X create dialog scene
	X standard layout
	X automatic callback
	X drag / drop
X move Engine to Scene / move engine to correct place
X draw dude on map
	X with shader
	X clean up opengl = 2
X convert to tinyxml2
