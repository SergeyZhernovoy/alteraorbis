	x text report on events as they happen (greater MOBS getting named, major fires, major waterfalls)
	- text report on major battles
	x text report on the rise and fall of other domains (mantis and gob-men. obviously needs to be implemented first)

---------- Defer ----------
x mobs rush new domains (teleport out? really really sector herd?)
d different porch color for usable buildings
d volcanos: taper at the end
d zoom way out
d put metadata in model (authoring  time)
d render-through for player behind objects
d change shield to have cooldown then charge-up (rather than cooldown then reset)
d unify rockgen and worldgen. frustrating they are separate steps. or don't pass height to rockgen?
d AIs should account for personality and skills when doing inventory sorting
d rings deflect bolts. too much AI change.
d switch to ImageMagick for texture scaling
- animation sync is generally flakey - lock to vsync? Not aware of any way to solve this.
d when loading during grid travel, you sometimes back up. (Regen path on load; chooses wrong starting point. annoying to fix).
d GT bug: reconsider auto-mip. review texture upload. 
d bone filter in reverse. more efficient and useful.
- use optimizer to pre-process shaders
- bolt: glow around white core? end caps?
- particles that aren't quads (beziers)
- pack animation bone info into shaders
- effects
	- environment: water contains fire, spreads shock
	- down chain: a fire creature should catch things on fire that it holds

V2 ideas:
- content popups when you are near a kiosk (email from GT)
- "populous style" rocks. diagonals, points.
- level up grid and special skills

x GT: use color/glow to show building control / ownership / working (2/20/2015)

		on the grid itself? Always come in from world center?
	x actually tell what you have tagged to clear
	x create new workers (they get wiped out)
	x new Portal model
	x fix rockgen to give space around portals

	x free camera: doesn't go to sector herd
	x free camera: turning off doesn't go back to playerx redo AvoidOthers(). Full crunch stops break the game.
x not showing bolt impacts
x health is awkward: keeps copy of HP (oops). move hp to health component? (TotalHP() on item?)
x integers for discrete values (hp, gold)
x remove UI button for track - only teleport (or at least hide)
x support melee attack on rocks
x sector-herding still getting stuck. Go back to random re-herd?
	x guarentee path to core
	x clear space around core
x remove temporary arbitrary AI limit in corescript
x add portals
x more critters
x space around ports
x sector herding: more aggressive? wider range?
x arrays in spatial query much, much too dangerous. Support CArray?
x explosion is in the wrong direction. Units walk through explosions?? (Balrog vs. Human.)
x touching buttons clears tracking and can leave in weird state where camera doesn't track player
x update the "procedural rendering" wiki
x does fire affect plants??
x cameras only self-delete if they reach destination; should do better. Probably
  should only be one camera in existence. (BlueSmoke, NavTest2)
x refactor code - if needed? - in AIComponent (the fixmes)
x faces are using too much memory, or too low res...hmmm. Should really use texture packer and store a lookup.
x handle device loss in live preview
x rationalize hardpoints: array index or flag? lookt at RenderComponent
x mantis trigger broken
x particles should use palette. <color palette="2 3 1.0"/> possibly
x shadows should be part of space-tree bounds
x resize in game screen wipes out textures
x GridMoveComponent: deleteWhenDone in uninitialized. Remove API altogether? Or at least default true.
x lock camera (no slop) when in grid mode? Hides vsync problem
x need free camera mode
x control key is terrible...sometimes.

	x refactor gamescene - map and mini-map clicking should use the same code
	x pather per sector
	x fix inUse. wow. fix inUse. Then only isBlocked will be an awful hack.
		Note: fixed. Switched both inUse and isBlocked to callback. May require
		future optimazation.
	x simpler shaders
	x new start location
	x make sure cores are in correct place
	x textures

x mantis tribes - whos fighting who?
x awareness range is a little high. dobule the awareness (?) should forget even a focused target.
x check that shields and damage absorbing is working correctly. something seems wrong with shields - recharge?
x shield glow broken. so hard to tell not sure it's worth doing.
x The item / weapon system really isn't working, and it's complex. Needs coordination between
  renderer, item, and weapon system to know the current weapon. (!!) Would rather have a one
  weapon system (where the current weapon can be switched out.) See ComuteLeadingShot()

	x cave
	x pools
	x waterfall
	x lava gen
	x fast-step world sim
x need different particle effect for melee impact
x run & gun and explosive weapons is probably a bad idea. But shoot for explosive should
  be much more likely.
x chits should have "update time" not boolean flag
x volcano delayed on save/load cycle (size getting set to zero?)
x water creation seems deferred to save/load cycle. SetRock() not quite correct?
x assert when clicking on location player can't go
x crash on exit
x really must fix the shadow popping bug. and bounds calc for that.
x need teleport mode
x save / load rocks
x get stuck when teleporting
x drawcalls debugging for all scenes
x procedural rendering
	x more glasses colors
	x fix glasses: they can be tightly packed, and occurance done in script
	d procedural: the shading should "go through" so that a shadow on layer 3 is renderered below colors are layer0
	x move texture coordinate calc to script
	x static scene showing item combinations

	x buttons to select scenario, load items
	x shock should affect shields, fire should diminish even when flammable, and shockable should diminish
	x restore micropather cache
	X error in ray-cast: detecting a 'tree' where it shouldn't (near the head of the prime)
	x adjust particles to have "impact" effect
	X don't check for item destroyed/death on DAMAGE msg - needs to be moved to tick.
	x bolts are hitting own team	
	X eval: kinetic damage of held weapons shouldn't be multiplied with mass (added)
	X properly hook up items and such, so that items, health, all be driven correctly
	X fix particle def to return a default - the pointer is dangerous
	X DebugDraw is getting used for release drawing - fine in most (all?) cases. But clean up.
	X hesitation when near melee target (probably squatted destination code kicking in)
	  (possibly shader kicking in: never seen it happen twice). Not actually fixed - may need
	  GL optimizer - but definitely the shader kicking in
	X weapons
		X relative positioning (implemented, broken again)
		X weapon definition - item question: how is a chit a weapon?
		X item d	X why does balrog just stand around not attacking mantis
	X ...and yet the AOE of melee seems huge. clean all that up.
	X human runs up to dummy, circles around it
	X data driven item creation
	X leaving guy standing after battle
	X debugging info for chit ticks
	X back in the tick system: the "need tick" vs. "no tick" changes. Note for 
	  example whether an item has effects applied. Or the kind of animation. Don't
	  want to tick granite chunks when they don't need it. Key concerns: 
	  Rendering, Item that changes tick status
	X melee attack standing too close 
	X avoiding while pathing doesn't look quite correct
	X need left/right team, not species based
	X animation/lack of making me crazy. What plan?
	X particle effect for melee strike not "connected" to character
	X item definition: one big wad of data? handle "inherited items"?
	X use space tree query for impacted items. Everything that has a spatial component
	  is now in the table, so this should be "fixed".
	X need to check rotation in the path component
	X load in the correct lighting
	X put in license header
	X push to altera site
	X balrog fire attack
	X visual debugging: line drawing. check bolt impacts.
	X impact (light/heavy)
	X heavy weapons should do knockback, not just amount of damage/explosion
	X change bolt color
	X item: support speed, pass on to bolts
	X optimize start time
	X change effect strategy - are all effects just flags?

X what is going on with engine state when there are 2 textures?
X RenderState search is reversed
X clean up shields
X move EngineShaders local
X one item array
X extend rendering test to animation

	X define skeletal animation export
	X modify shaders
	X blend animations
X rotation: in spatial component? Matrix or Quat?
X NavTest-1 is broken. More container fallout. And once again an existing bug
  revealed by tighter container code.
X container to support copy semantics
X remove particle params not needed for world
X move lighting loading from render test scene to engine
X Animation
	X support for instancing
	X particle tracking of meta-data

	X cross fading
	X revisit all scenes, add animation
		X Where does animation fit in? walk, gun-run, impact-, melee
		X Render: query walking/standing from Move component?
		X The AnimatedRenderComponent is annoying - move code to RenderComponent
X blur: switch to "down blit" approach, optionally
X Blue Smoke Map Test
	X full size (1024x1024), 2000 units
		X faster avoidance
			X separate avoid queries from spatial queries
			X hash scheme needs work
		X faster Model::Update
			X don't re-link if possible on update. model probably is in the same node.
			X faster AABB calc? are we using normals? should we?
			D don't update things well outside the rendering area? switch to local rendering?
			D re-tune tree size
			X switch to sphere testing. avoid flushing the AABB entirely
	X need to get to 2000 faster
	X entity debug system: point at chit, get component info
	X some units get stuck and never move (pathing fails & doesn't re-start?)
	X fix camera code
	X need a mini-map
	X filling of path cache: correct? why does the cache keep incrementing? what should the game do when it's full?
