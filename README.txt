About
-----
Altera is a simulation of an alternate world; a world inside
the computer. You play as a Domain Core trying to grow and
survive in an ever changing digital world.

Altera Orbis started as Syndicate reimagined to be a a 
Dungeon-Keeperish / Dwarf Fortressy sort of game set in a 
Star Wars-ian & Tron-esqe world. It keeps changing and 
developing.

Altera Orbis is in Beta, and will be until it's ready;
thanks for playing and checking the game out. Feedback
on the forums is appreciated!

Ctrl-Right-click & drag rotates and zooms the camera.

Install
-------

Run the installer; it will install the game into your Program Files (x86) and save 
files into the Documents directory. The redistributables will be installed as 
well. (If in doubt, re-install of the redistributables is harmless.) You can 
safely install over old game installations.


Important Notes
---------------

1. There is rarely save game compatibility. Old games will be automatically ignored.
2. The game is intended to run on a tablet (Windows tablets only at this point) but touch controls aren't implemented yet. Although
   the new control scheme is intended to make touch as seamless as possible.


Filing a Bug
------------

If you find an issue,
1. Make sure your graphics drivers are up to date. I know, it's annoying, and every game says this. But the OpenGL drivers (especially on windows) make a big difference.
2. Open an issue here, by pushing the "new issue" in the upper left; http://code.google.com/p/alteraorbis/issues/list
3. Write down the steps to reproduce
4. IMPORTANT: include the release_log.txt file. It is written anew every time you run the game, so be sure to include the log that show the problem you are submitting.

Extra info for bug:
The rendering features can be toggled with the number keys. If you a rendering bug, knowing if it can be toggled on/off is very valuable information. For example, if you spot the "blue wall" rendering bug, you can tap (1) to turn off glow, then (1) to turn glow back on. If the "blue wall" goes away then returns, it's part of the glow rendering.

1: glow
2: particles
3: voxel
4: shadow
5: bolt
