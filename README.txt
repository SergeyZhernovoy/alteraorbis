About
-----
Altera is a simulation of an alternate world; a world inside
the computer. You play as a Domain Core trying to grow and
survive in an ever changing digital world.

Altera Orbis started as Syndicate reimagined to be a a 
Dungeon-Keeperish / Dwarf Fortressy sort of game set in a 
Star Wars-ian & Tron-esqe world. It keeps changing and 
developing.

Altera Orbis is in Beta, and will be until it's ready;
thanks for playing and checking the game out. Feedback
on the forums is appreciated!

FAQ
---
Why do denizens just stand there or get stuck?

	Make sure you don't have a portch that isn't accessible. They may be 
	trying to get to a facility and can't.

Why is everyone carrying fruit?

	You don't have a distillery, or the distillery can't keep up
	with production. Build another distillery.


Controls
--------

'Tab' key toggles between top down and isometric views.
'Home' key centers the camera on your core.
'End' key centers the camera on your avatar; if already centered, the
  end key teleports the avatar home.
'Escape' key backs out of the menus back to 'view' mode.

Left-click moves the avatar, selects things, builds.
Left-click & drag builds lots of pavement or ice at once, or clears an area.
Shift-left-click on rock or plants attack the rock/plants.

Right-click & drag moves the camera.
Ctrl-Right-click & drag rotates and zooms the camera.

The arrow keys or WASD moves the camera.
Ctrl-Arrow keys or ctrl-WASD rotates and zooms.

If in build mode, but no building selected (so click "Build" but don't select
a building), then left-click & drag rotates buildings.

F11 toggles full screen.
F3 saves a screenshots. (In Documents/Altera Orbis)


Install
-------

Run the installer; it will install the game into your Program Files (x86) and 
save files into the Documents directory. The redistributables will be installed
as well. (If in doubt, re-install of the redistributables is harmless.) You can 
safely install over old game installations.


Important Notes
---------------

1. Save game compatibility in only with the release #. Beta1a to Beta1d can use
   the same save files, but Beta1 and Beta2 do not. Old games will be 
   automatically ignored.
2. The game is intended to run on a tablet (Windows tablets only at this point) 
   but touch controls aren't implemented yet. Although the new control scheme 
   is intended to make touch as seamless as possible.


Filing a Bug
------------

If you find an issue,
1. Make sure your graphics drivers are up to date. I know, it's annoying, and 
   every game says this. But the OpenGL drivers (especially on windows) make  
   a big difference. OpenGL 3.1 has rendering issues. OpenGL 3.2 and higher
   should work.
2. Open a "new issue" at http://code.google.com/p/alteraorbis/issues/list
3. Write down the steps to reproduce
4. IMPORTANT: include the release_log.txt file. It is written anew every time 
   you run the game, so be sure to include the log that show the problem you 
   are submitting.

Extra info for bug:
The rendering features can be toggled with the number keys. If you a rendering 
bug, knowing if it can be toggled on/off is very valuable information. For 
example, if you spot the "blue wall" rendering bug, you can tap (1) to turn off
glow, then (1) to turn glow back on. If the "blue wall" goes away then returns,
it's part of the glow rendering.

1: glow
2: particles
3: voxel
4: shadow
5: bolt
